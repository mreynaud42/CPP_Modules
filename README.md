## CPP Modules (00–09)

This repository contains all C++ modules from the 42 curriculum, ranging from Module 00 to Module 09.

These modules are designed to progressively introduce modern C++ concepts, starting from basic syntax and object-oriented programming, and advancing toward more complex topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL).

Each module focuses on specific concepts and best practices, encouraging clean code, proper memory management, and a solid understanding of C++ fundamentals.  
Together, these modules provide a comprehensive overview of C++ programming through practical and incremental exercises.

## Modules Overview

| Module | Topics Covered |
|------|----------------|
| CPP 00 | Namespaces, classes, member functions, std::iostream |
| CPP 01 | Memory allocation, references, pointers, switch statements |
| CPP 02 | Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, Orthodox Canonical Form |
| CPP 03 | Inheritance, access specifiers |
| CPP 04 | Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces |
| CPP 05 | Exceptions, error handling |
| CPP 06 | C++ casts, type conversion |
| CPP 07 | Templates |
| CPP 08 | Templated containers, iterators, algorithms |
| CPP 09 | STL containers, algorithms, advanced data handling |

## Instructions

Each C++ module is located in its own directory (`CPP_Module_00` to `CPP_Module_09`) and contains multiple exercises.  
Each exercise provides its own `Makefile`.

### Compilation

Navigate to the desired module and exercise directory, then run:

```bash
make
```

### Execution

Run the generated executable:
```bash
./program
```
(The executable name may vary depending on the exercise.)

## Key Concepts

Throughout these modules, the following C++ concepts are covered:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, constructors, destructors
- Encapsulation and access control
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Exception handling
- Type casting
- Templates and generic programming
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Iterators and algorithms
- Memory management and resource handling

### Use of AI

No artificial intelligence tools were used during the development of these projects.  
AI was only used afterward to assist in writing this README file.
